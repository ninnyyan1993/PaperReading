Finds an object pose from 3D-2D point correspondences.
This function returns the rotation and the translation vectors that transform a 3D point expressed in the object coordinate frame to the camera coordinate frame, using different methods:

- P3P methods (SOLVEPNP_P3P, SOLVEPNP_AP3P): need 4 input points to return a unique solution.
- SOLVEPNP_IPPE Input points must be >= 4 and object points must be coplanar(共面).
- SOLVEPNP_IPPE_SQUARE Special case suitable for marker pose estimation. Number of input points must be 4. Object points must be defined in the following order:
    point 0: [-squareLength / 2, squareLength / 2, 0]
    point 1: [ squareLength / 2, squareLength / 2, 0]
    point 2: [ squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]
    point 3: [-squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]
- for all the other flags, number of input points must be >= 4 and object points can be in any configuration.

[Flags of solvePnP](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d5/d1f/calib3d_solvePnP.html#calib3d_solvePnP_flags)

- cv::SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE **Default solution**. Iterative method is based on a **Levenberg-Marquardt** optimization. In this case the function finds such a pose that minimizes reprojection error, that is the sum of squared distances between the observed projections "imagePoints" and the projected (using cv::projectPoints ) "objectPoints". Initial solution for non-planar(非平面) "objectPoints" needs at least 6 points and uses the DLT algorithm. Initial solution for planar "objectPoints" needs at least 4 points and uses pose from *homography decomposition*（单应性分解）.

- cv::SOLVEPNP_P3P Method is based on the paper of X.S. Gao, X.-R. Hou, J. Tang, H.-F. Chang "Complete Solution Classification for the Perspective-Three-Point Problem". In this case the function requires **exactly 4** object and image points.=>same as use **solveP3P with same flag**

- cv::SOLVEPNP_AP3P Method is based on the paper of T. Ke, S. Roumeliotis "An Efficient Algebraic Solution to the Perspective-Three-Point Problem" . In this case the function requires **exactly 4** object and image points.=>same as use **solveP3P with same flag**

- cv::SOLVEPNP_EPNP Method has been introduced by F. Moreno-Noguer, V. Lepetit and P. Fua in the paper "EPnP: Efficient Perspective-n-Point Camera Pose Estimation" .

- cv::SOLVEPNP_DLS *Broken implementation*. Using this flag will **fallback to EPnP**.

- cv::SOLVEPNP_UPNP Broken implementation. Using this flag will **fallback to EPnP**.

- cv::SOLVEPNP_IPPE Method is based on the paper of T. Collins and A. Bartoli. "Infinitesimal Plane-Based Pose Estimation". This method requires **coplanar** object points.

- cv::SOLVEPNP_IPPE_SQUARE Method is based on the paper of Toby Collins and Adrien Bartoli. "Infinitesimal Plane-Based Pose Estimation". This method is suitable for **marker pose estimation**. It requires **4 coplanar** object points defined in the following order:
point 0: [-squareLength / 2, squareLength / 2, 0]
point 1: [ squareLength / 2, squareLength / 2, 0]
point 2: [ squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]
point 3: [-squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]

- cv::SOLVEPNP_SQPNP Method is based on the paper "A Consistently Fast and Globally Optimal Solution to the Perspective-n-Point Problem" by G. Terzakis and M.Lourakis. It requires **3** or more points.

## cv::SOLVEPNP_EPNP: Paper 008

论文内容：

propose a non-iterative solution to the PnP problem—the estimation of the pose of a cali- brated camera from n 3D-to-2D point correspondences— whose computational complexity grows linearly with n.

EPNP是求解PnP问题的非迭代方法。
优势是:
1. 时间复杂度低，O（n），其他的是指数级，所以耗时短；
2. 不依赖初始化；
3. 鲁棒性高；
4. 误差小。
5. 用高斯牛顿方法可以进一步提高准确率，但计算耗时不会太大。

看论文里的实验数据，EPNP方法求得的rotation和translation存在随着匹配点数的增多，逐渐收敛趋于稳定的过程

图上看的话，噪声恒定的情况下，差不多10个点左右趋于收敛。
